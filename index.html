  <summary>More about me</summary>
    <p>Hey! I'm Remy, an avatar of organised chaos.</p>

<p>I've been playing video games since I was old enough to walk and started out playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega MEGADRIVE.</p>

<p>I grew up on consoles throughout my childhood and obsessed deeply over platformers, RTS and RPG style games until I was old enough to play online when I received my first internet capable computer at 13, and started playing MMOs and online shooters.</p>

<p>I've never been one for serious competition, mostly because: </p>
<ol>
<li>I Suck and</li>
<li>Have the attention span of a squirrel in a park full of nuts.</li>
</ol>
<p>But that hasn't stopped me from having a good laugh and some solid plays in games like CS:GO, Call of Duty, Battlefield, or my current go-to for angry russian bulletstorms, Escape from Tarkov.</p>

<p>I also play a range of other games from various genres, and have a deep and abiding love of space simulators and Sci-fi games.</p>

<p>Currently I work as an Engineer and enjoy my weekends gaming, and this is where I decided to take up streaming so others can enjoy my personal brand of chaos and the occasional serious game.</p>
